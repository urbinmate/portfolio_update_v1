          <h2>Playing Guitar</h2>
          <p>If you have an electric guitar you will need an amp and lead (see pictures) but whatever you have you have I would recommend buying a plectrum (A.K.A pick) choose a medium or light type as they are most suited to beginners.
            You could also get a tuner but they are not totally necessary (see next step)</p>
          <p>The easiest way to tune your guitar is to twist the pegs at the top so the tones match up to whats coming out of the speakers for each string. You can also buy a tuner from a music shop but that would be an extra expense and the online on would do nearly as well..</p>

          <h2>Reading Books</h2>
          <p>One of the primary benefits of reading books is its ability to develop critical thinking skills. For example, reading a mystery novel sharpens your mind.
          A few books I've currently read:</p>
          <ul class="skills">
            <li>HTML & CSS by John Duckett</li>
            <li>SPRINT by Jake Knapp</li>
            <li>The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg</li>

          </ul>
          <p>Solving Rubic's Cube is one of my favorite hobbies. I can solve 2x2, 3x3, and also 4x4 versions. Also, the cube is named after Ern≈ë Rubik, who is also from Hungary. </p>
